## **Introduction**

In today's digital age, verifying the identity of individuals has become a critical concern for businesses and organizations. Traditional methods such as captcha and one-time password (OTP) verification have been used, but they are not foolproof and can be easily circumvented. To address this issue, various methodologies have been deployed, including physical verification and video conferencing methods. However, these methods have limitations and may not provide the desired level of security.

One technology that holds great promise for identity verification is facial recognition. Facial recognition technology has advanced significantly in recent years, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. It allows for accurate and efficient identification of individuals based on their unique facial features.

Another challenge in identity verification is the storage of sensitive and confidential data. With the increasing volume of data, centralized systems struggle to handle the massive amount of information securely. To overcome this limitation, blockchain technology has emerged as a potential solution. Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure method of storing data, making it an ideal candidate for storing biometric information.
## **Motivation**
The motivation behind this research work is to develop a secured blockchain-based facial recognition system that can be used for two-factor authentication processes. The goal is to enhance the privacy and security of individuals' biometric data while providing an efficient and reliable method of identity verification.
## **Tools Used**
To implement this project, several tools and technologies are required. These include:

1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Algorithms**: AI algorithms, particularly deep learning algorithms, are used for facial feature extraction and recognition.
1. **Blockchain Technology**: Blockchain technology provides the underlying infrastructure for storing and verifying facial templates securely.
1. **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined rules. They are used to manage the enrollment, verification, and storage of facial data on the blockchain.
1. **Consensus Mechanism**: A consensus mechanism is required to ensure the integrity and consensus of the stored facial templates. Various consensus mechanisms, such as proof of work (PoW) or proof of stake (PoS), can be implemented.
1. **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface is developed to allow users to enroll, verify, and manage their facial data easily.
## **Steps to Implement This Project**
To implement the secured blockchain-based facial recognition system, the following steps can be followed:

1. **System Design**: Define the system architecture and components required for the facial recognition system. This includes the AI algorithms, blockchain infrastructure, smart contracts, and user interface.
1. **Data Collection**: Collect a dataset of facial images for training the AI algorithms. The dataset should include a diverse range of individuals to ensure accurate recognition across different demographics.
1. **AI Algorithm Development**: Develop AI algorithms for facial feature extraction and recognition. Train the algorithms using the collected dataset to ensure accurate and reliable identification.
1. **Blockchain Integration**: Integrate the developed AI algorithms with the blockchain infrastructure. This involves designing and implementing smart contracts for enrolling, verifying, and storing facial data on the blockchain.
1. **Consensus Mechanism Selection**: Choose a suitable consensus mechanism to ensure the integrity and consensus of the stored facial templates. Consider factors such as security, scalability, and energy efficiency.
1. **User Interface Development**: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to enroll, verify, and manage their facial data. The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
## **Advantages of a Secured Blockchain-Based Facial Recognition System**
A secured blockchain-based facial recognition system offers several advantages over traditional methods of identity verification. These include:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and immutable method of storing facial templates, making it highly secure and resistant to tampering.
1. **Privacy Protection**: By storing hashed templates or encrypted data on the blockchain, the system ensures the privacy of individuals' biometric information.
1. **Efficient Verification**: Facial recognition technology allows for quick and accurate identification of individuals, providing a seamless and efficient verification process.
1. **Decentralization**: By distributing the blockchain nodes across different servers, the system ensures decentralization and enhances security.
1. **Smart Contracts**: The use of smart contracts enables the automation and management of various processes, such as enrollment, verification, and data storage.
## **Difference Between This Project and Others**
While there have been previous research works on blockchain-based face recognition systems, this project aims to provide a secured and efficient two-factor authentication process. By integrating advanced AI algorithms with blockchain technology, the system ensures the privacy and security of individuals' biometric data while offering an efficient and reliable method of identity verification.
